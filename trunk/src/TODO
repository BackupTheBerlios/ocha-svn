- get data from ~/.recently-used http://standards.freedesktop.org/recent-file-spec/recent-file-spec-0.2.html

- keep recent windows/recently-used in memory (lastuse flag on catalog does not apply to them)
- weight results, really
- count accesses and use that to weight results
- get URLs from firefox history file (see notes/mork.pl and http://www.livejournal.com/users/jwz/312657.html)
- canonize file paths
- replace paths with URI
- check result validity
