    <h1>Checking out and compiling ocha</h1>

    <p>
      This document quickly describes how to checkout ocha from subversion
      and compile it. It is meant for developers. Most people will be
      happy downloading the distribution and following the instructions
      given in the documentation or on the <a href="http://ocha.berlios.de/">homepage</a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Why would you want to compile ocha straight out of subversion ? Maybe because
      you would like to fix it. Maybe you would like to get access to the latest
      version with all the unstable features. Maybe you just like danger... Whatever
      the reason, here's what you should do:
    </p>

    <h2>1. Checkout out the latest version</h2>

    <p>A <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/docman/display_doc.php?docid=394&amp;group_id=2">Subversion HOWTO</a> 
    is available on berlios.de. I won't get into details here, just give the command 
    you need to type to checkout the main version of ocha:</p>

    <pre>
svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/ocha/trunk
    </pre>

    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> the version of ocha on subversion may not work 
    at all, may not do anything useful or may not even compile at all. Don't be 
    surprised if something goes wrong; just report it on the 
    <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/forum/forum.php?forum_id=10452">developers forum</a>
    </p>

    <h2>2. Make sure you've got everything</h2>
    
    <p>
      In addition to everything you need to compile and run ocha that's listed
      in the documentation, you'll need the following software to build ocha
      straight out of subversion:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>gnome-autogen.sh</li>
      <li>autoconf >= 2.53</li>
      <li>automake >= 1.6</li>
      <li>libtool >= 1.5</li>
      <li>pkg-config >= 0.14.0</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The most important of all these and the hardest to find is probably <code>gnome-autogen.sh</code>. It's
      the script that does all the work of generating the <code>configure</code> script you'll need to
      compile the application. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You will find <code>gnome-autogen.sh</code> in a package called <code>gnome-common</code> 
      in most distribution (at least Debian and Fedora.) GNOME distribute it under this name as well.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Generate the configure script</h3>

    <p>
      Go into the ocha's <code>trunk</code> directory and run <code>./autogen.sh</code>. It'll
      generate <code>configure</code> and run it for the first time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once this is done, you can edit the source files and run <code>make</code> to compile it, as
      usual.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Run the test cases (make check)</h3>
    
    <p>
      Depending on what you're working on, you might want to run the test cases using <code>make check</code>. 
      This won't work unless you've got the library <code>check</code> version <code>0.9.2</code> or more
      installed on your system. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Download it from <a href="http://check.sourceforge.net">check.sourceforge.net</a>. It is also
      available in a Debian package called <code>check</code>.
    </p>

    <h4>5. Generate the API documentation (make doxygen)</h4>
    
    <p>
      The API documentation might help you find your way into the code. To generate it, first
      install <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">doxygen</a>. Then go into the directory <code>src</code>
      and type <code>make doxygen</code>. You'll then find the generated API documentation in HTML in <code>doc/devel/api/html</code>.
