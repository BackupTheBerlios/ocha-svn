WHAT IS IT ?
------------

Ocha periodically indexes your files, applications and 
Mozilla/Firefox bookmarks and then you open a file by 
typing parts of its name. 

This is inspired from Quicksilver, that runs on OSX.

INSTALLATION
--------

- run the configure script: (see INSTALL)
  ./configure 
- build the executables
  make 
- install (as root):
  make install

USAGE
-----

Quickstart: type 'ocha' on the command line

Usage is described in ocha-manual and in the man pages 
ocha(1) and ochad(1).

To see ocha-manual, here's what you can do:

1. See installed HTML version in 
  /usr/share/doc/ocha/ocha-manual.html
  PACKAGEDIR/doc/ocha-manual.html
2. Use scrollkeeper (yelp):
  yelp PACKAGEDIR/doc/ocha-manual.xml
